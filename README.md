# Hike-app

## Introduction :

This project was an exercice provided by BeCode to help learn PHP in its basic form.
It was a group project and my co-worker on this one was [Francis Fran√ßois](https://github.com/FrancisFrancois).

We jumped in the project with zero knowledge of PHP and built the project as our understanding of the language grew.
I understand now we did not use an architecture that could scale. And if I was to re-do the project I would probably dig a bit more into the MVC model.

All things considered though, we managed to reach the deadline with some spare time and the website is fully functional.
